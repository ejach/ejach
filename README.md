### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

### I am Evan J. 

I am currently a full-time student pursuing a degree in Computer Information Systems with a minor in business administration. I have experience in JavaScript, Java, C/C++ and Python. I am actively learning new languages and concepts whenever I find time. Aside from programming, I invest my time in furthering my experience in game development, cybersecurity, and computer hardware.
